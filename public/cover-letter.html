          <span class="mark-like">Dear Hiring Manager,</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Something <strong>great</strong> just came across my desk, it's your
          <em>open position</em>, and I can say with full confidence that it
          aligns perfectly with my skills, experience, and the way I operate
          as your <em>new potential candidate</em>. I bring a unique mix of
          technical expertise, leadership under pressure, and a results-driven
          mindset that’s been sharpened through careers in both network
          engineering and public service.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my current role as a <strong>Network Project Engineer</strong> at
          Provalus, I manage large-scale 911 network migrations across 20
          states. I regularly coordinate between vendors, government agencies,
          and internal engineering teams to ensure operational uptime and FCC
          compliance. Before that, I led a Network Operations Center of 16
          analysts, within Provalus, boosting SLA performance to
          <strong>99%</strong> and establishing training and escalation
          systems that still guide the department today.
        </p>

        <p>
          I bring hands-on troubleshooting across Cisco platforms, deep packet
          analysis with Wireshark and Nmap, and a service mindset shaped by
          law enforcement and military experience. I thrive in high-stakes
          environments where uptime and accuracy matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          What makes me <strong><u>different</u></strong> is the blend of
          discipline from the military, problem-solving from law enforcement,
          and precision from engineering. Whether I’m troubleshooting BGP
          routing, documenting PSAP migrations, or mentoring new technicians,
          I take ownership of every outcome. I’m not just looking for a job,
          I'm looking for a career I can call my second home. I’m looking for
          the right environment where I can strengthen systems, empower teams,
          and deliver measurable results.
        </p>

        <p>
          I would love to discuss how I can support your network reliability
          goals and how I can bring that same level of commitment and energy
          to your organization. Thank you for your time and consideration and
          I look forward to connecting soon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sincerely,<br /><br /><mark><strong>Your Future Employee:</strong></mark><br />
